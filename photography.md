I consider myself a passionate being. **Astronomy** has been my childhood passion. **Photography** and **diary entry** are a part of my daily routine. I can not sleep well if I am not surrounded by **books**. I am fasicnated by Impressionism, it would be a lie if I deny that **Vincent Van Gogh** became my obsession. Songs of **Bryan Admas** can still struck a chord in me. Walking in the **forest** and **admiring trees** became my addiction.

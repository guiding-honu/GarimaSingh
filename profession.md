### What do I do exactly?

Develop instruments for ground-based telescopes (8-10 meters) to search and directly image (exo-)planets outside of our solar system. Below, you may find three public articles I wrote, describing the research problem we are trying to solve:-  <br />
- [World beyond ours](https://www.esperluette-research-outreach.com/single-post/2019/07/08/Worlds-beyond-ours).
- Improving data interpretation of exoplanet images [(page 27)](Page27_MCAA_Newsletter_December_2019_v5.pdf).
- [Paving the way for improving exoplanet imaging with ground-based telescopes](PRJ5-EXOPLANETS-Prfd_v4.pdf).

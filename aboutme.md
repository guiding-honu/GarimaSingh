I was born and brought up in the city of [Haridwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridwar), one of the holiest places for Hindus in Northern India. I was raised in a family which followed both Hinduism and Sikhism. I am neither an atheist nor a blind follower of rituals and religious practices. My heart is inclined more towards this undeniable calming presence I feel in my surroundings. From the very early age, I knew I had a purpose. So, I spent most of my childhood musing with the Universe and adult life in following my dreams. 

**Astronomy** has been my childhood passion. **Photography** and **diary entry** are a part of my daily routine. I cannot sleep well if I am not surrounded by **books**. I am fascinated by Impressionism and it would be a lie if I deny that **Vincent van Gogh** became my obsession. Being able to **paint** and occasionally  **sculpt** soothe my urge of creating something with my own hands. Walking in the **forest** and **admiring trees** is my addiction. I see characters in trees and yes, I love greeting them, sometimes out loud, sometimes only in my head. I love feeding **birds** and appreciate their presence around me. I am an aspiring **Cellist** and I dream of playing Gabriel Fauré [Élégie Op. 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hUJKqHTOEI). I believe in the philosophy of **cause and effect** and **Buddhism** provides good source of food to my thoughts. I am incredibly blessed to have found a yearning desire of studying my own mind deeply.

My actual website "https://equanimouscorner.com" is underway and will be published in a few months.

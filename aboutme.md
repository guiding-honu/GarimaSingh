I was born and brought up in the city of [Haridwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridwar), one of the holiest places for Hindus in Northern India. I was raised in a family which followed both Hinduism and Sikhism. I am neither an atheist nor a blind follower of rituals and religious practices. My heart is inclined more towards this undeniable calming presence I feel in my surroundings. From the very early age, I knew I had a purpose. So, I spent most of my childhood musing with the Universe and adult life in following my dreams. 

**Astronomy** has been my childhood passion. **Photography** and **diary entry** are a part of my daily routine. I love collecting **fountain pens**, quill pens and ink pots. I cannot sleep well if I am not surrounded by **books**. I am fascinated by **Impressionism** and it would be a lie if I deny that **Vincent van Gogh** became my obsession. Sometimes, I feel nostalgic for the time I never knew. Apparently, there's a word for that, *Anemoia*. Being able to **paint** and occasionally **sculpt** soothe my urge of creating something with my own hands. Walking in the **forest** and **admiring trees** are my addictions. I see characters in trees and I love greeting them, sometimes out loud, sometimes only in my head. I love feeding birds and appreciate their presence around me. I am an aspiring **Cellist** and I dream of playing [Gabriel Fauré Élégie Op. 24.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hUJKqHTOEI) I believe in the philosophy of **cause and effect** and **Buddhism** provides a good source of food for my thoughts. I am incredibly blessed to have found a yearning desire of studying my own mind deeply.

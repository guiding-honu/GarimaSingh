I consider myself a passionate being. **Astronomy** has been my childhood passion. **Photography** and **diary entry** are a part of my daily routine. I cannot sleep well if I am not surrounded by **books**. I am fascinated by Impressionism, it would be a lie if I deny that **Vincent Van Gogh** became my obsession. Songs of **Bryan Adams** can still struck a chord in me. Walking in the **forest** and **admiring trees** became my addiction. I see characters in trees and yes, I love greeting them, sometimes out loud, sometimes only in my head. I believe in the philosophy of **cause and effect**. I am incredibly blessed to have found a yearning desire of studying the science of mind more deeply.

I love writing and have a desire of writing a book one day. Recently, I wrote an article on healing for a friend's blog. The process of writing this article made me to reflect deeply on my life experiences. Somehow, I gathered courage and pour out my heart. I called this article: [“Stardust over my wounds”](https://www.serene-sereine.com/post/stardust-over-my-wounds). I was amazed to see how a few strangers who read this article were able to resonate with my words. Using this motivation as a propeller, I am now thinking to write a book which would include my external astronomical journey from India to NASA, my internal journey from being a victim of circumstances to becoming an awakened witness of life events, stories of courage and strength I accumulated along the way and a crash course on Adaptive Optics and Exoplanets .

I was born and brought up in the city of [Haridwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridwar), one of the holiest places for Hindus in Northern India. I was raised in a family which followed both Hinduism and Sikhism. I am neither an atheist nor a blind follower of rituals and religious practices. My heart is inclined more towards this undeniable calming presence I feel in my surroundings. From the very early age, I knew I had a purpose. So, I spent most of my childhood musing with the Universe and adult life in following my dreams. 

**Astronomy** has been my childhood passion. **Photography** and **diary entry** are a part of my daily routine. I cannot sleep well if I am not surrounded by **books**. I am fascinated by Impressionism and it would be a lie if I deny that **Vincent Van Gogh** became my obsession. Being able to **paint** and occasionally  **sculpt** soothe my urge of creating something with my own hands. Walking in the **forest** and **admiring trees** is my addiction. I see characters in trees and yes, I love greeting them, sometimes out loud, sometimes only in my head. I love feeding **birds** and appreciate their presence around me. I am an aspiring **Cellist**, though can barely play for the moment. I believe in the philosophy of **cause and effect** and **Buddhism** provides good source of food to my thoughts. I am incredibly blessed to have found a yearning desire of studying my own mind deeply.

I love writing and have a desire of writing a book one day. Recently, I wrote an article on healing for a friend's blog. The process of writing this article gave me an opportunity to reflect deeply on my life experiences, especially on my struggles. I was able to gather courage and poured out my heart. I called this article: [“Stardust over my wounds”](https://www.serene-sereine.com/post/stardust-over-my-wounds). I was amazed to see how some of my colleagues and a few strangers who read this article were able to resonate with my words. I have a lot more to say and thanks to the positive feedback on this article, I feel really motivated to further share my innerself with the world. The book that I am thinking about will include my external astronomical journey from Haridwar to NASA, my internal journey from being a victim of my circumstances to becoming an awakened witness to my life events, stories of courage and strength I accumulated along the way and a crash course on Adaptive Optics and direct imaging of Exoplanets. I am really looking forward to this writing experience. (Written in September 2021)
